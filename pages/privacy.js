        <p data-v-4db97653>
            Aigence Limited (Aigence) is a SaaS platform that automates the onboarding, payroll and day to day managmnet of employment issues.
        </p><p data-v-4db97653>
            We provide tools that free. As part of this, we help educate our industry and
            raise awareness of cyber security risks and we do this via our
            <a href="https://pushsecurity.com" data-v-4db97653>pushsecurity.com</a>, blog,
            email communications, and application integrations with other
            SaaS providers including Google, Microsoft, and Slack.
            Throughout this Privacy Policy we will refer to all of these
            collectively as “Services”.
        </p><p data-v-4db97653>
            Depending on the context of personal information you provide, we
            may be the data controller or data processor of your personal
            information under this policy. We are a processor of Client Data
            - personal information submitted to the Services or collected
            through the Services on behalf of or at the direction of
            customers.
        </p><p data-v-4db97653>
            Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information
            about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to
            that information.

            For any personal data we collect about users that directly
            access or have registered accounts to use our Services, we
            operate as the data controller - as we make important decisions
            around exactly which data to collect, how it is used, and we
            have direct relationships with those users.
        </p><p data-v-4db97653>
            This section covers all data we collect as the data controller;

                Information we collect
            </a></h3><p data-v-4db97653>
            We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do
            so - for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with
            you, or to make our Services better.
        </p><p data-v-4db97653>
            We collect this information from three sources: if and when you
            provide information to us, automatically through you operating
            our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the
            information that we collect.
        </p><h2 id="information-you-provide-to-us" data-v-4db97653><a href="#information-you-provide-to-us" data-scroll="" data-v-4db97653>

            </a></h2><p data-v-4db97653>
            It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you
            provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
        </p><ul data-v-4db97653><li data-v-4db97653><b data-v-4db97653>Basic account information:</b> We ask for basic
                information from you in order to set up your account. For
                example, we require individuals who sign up for an account
                to provide an email address and password, along with a
                username or name — and that’s it.
            </li><li data-v-4db97653><b data-v-4db97653>Credentials:</b> Depending on the Services you use, you
                may provide us with credentials for your SaaS platforms -
                for example, access tokens used by integrations.
            </li><li data-v-4db97653><b data-v-4db97653>Communications with us:</b> You may also provide us with
                information when you respond to surveys, communicate with us
                about a support question, or sign up for a newsletter. When
                you communicate with us via form, email, phone, or
                otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including
                any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).

            We also collect some information automatically:
        </p><ul data-v-4db97653><li data-v-4db97653><b data-v-4db97653>Log information:</b> Like most online service providers,
                we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices,
                and servers typically make available, including the browser
                type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language
                preference, referring site, the date and time of access,
                operating system, and mobile network information.
            </li><li data-v-4db97653><b data-v-4db97653>Usage information:</b> We collect information about your
                usage of our Services. For example, we collect information
                about the actions that users perform on our site — in other
                words, who did what and when. We also collect information
                about what happens when you use our Services (e.g. page
                views, support document searches). We use this information
                to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights
                on how people use our Services so we can make our Services
                better.
            </li><li data-v-4db97653><b data-v-4db97653>Location information:</b> We may determine the
                approximate location of your device from your IP address. We
                collect and use this information to, for example, calculate
                how many people visit our Services from certain geographic
                regions.
            </li><li data-v-4db97653><b data-v-4db97653>Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:</b> A
                cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
                visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides
                to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags
                (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on
                websites and emails. We use cookies and other technologies
                like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors,
                usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as
                track and understand email campaign usefulness. For more
                information about our use of cookies and other technologies
                for tracking, including how you can control the use of
                cookies, please see

            Information we collect from other sources
        </b><p data-v-4db97653>
            We may also get information about you from other sources. For
            example, if you create or log in to your account through a
            social login (like Google or Microsoft) we’ll receive
            information from that service (your username and basic profile
            information) via the authorization procedures for that service.
            As another example, if you use the chat feature on our website,
            our CRM system may provide us additional contextual information
            such as the company you might be connecting from based on your
            IP address. The information we receive depends on which services
            you use or authorize and what options are available.

                    Services.</b>
                For example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact
                with our Services so we can create new features that we
                think our users will enjoy or make our Services easier to
                use. We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as

                Data could be derived from your personal data but is not
                considered personal data in law as this data will not
                directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we

                illegal activity; complying with our legal obligations; and
                protecting the rights and property of Push and others, which

                How long we keep information
            </a></h3><p data-v-4db97653>
            To reduce our own risk and yours we generally discard
            information about you when it’s no longer needed for the
            purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the
            section above on
            <a data-scroll="" href="#how-and-why-we-use-information" data-v-4db97653>How and why we use information</a>
            — and we’re not legally required to keep it.
        </p><p data-v-4db97653>
            For example, we keep web server logs that record information
            about a visitor to our website, like the visitor’s IP address,
            browser type, and operating system, for no more than 90 days. We
            retain the logs for this period of time in order to investigate
            issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites, or there
            is a security incident.
        </p><p data-v-4db97653>
            Where possible we delete data immediately, for example, when you
            delete an integration we immediately delete the associated
            security tokens, however in some cases the deleted content may
            remain on our backups and caches until the next scheduled purge
            process completes.

            As our services are designed to be used by businesses, they are
            not intended for children under 16 years old. We do not
            knowingly collect personal information from children and if you
            believe we might have any information from or about a child

                you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send
                you other communications, like those about your account and

                websites may not function properly without the aid of
                cookies.
            </li><li data-v-4db97653><b data-v-4db97653>Close your account:</b> While we’d be very sad to see you

                retain some of your information after closing your account,
                as described in How long we keep information above — for
                example, when that information is reasonably needed to
                comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal
                obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably
                needed for our legitimate business interests.
